# Lemming pants

The purpose of this project is to develop a system to manage the speaker list of Datateknologsektionens meetings. Preferably in the simplest possible way.

Feel free to fork, do pull requests and post issues!

The name is much inspired by DHack's totem animal, the [lemming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A6vm92R9oU).

## Running in dev-mode

For development, the local web-server that serves the static resources is run by with this command `./de-server.sh`


## Running with docker
*Currently the docker images build but does not completely work*

Run `docker-build.sh` and wait for everything to build, then run `docker-compose up` and things should work.
