# Lemming pants

The purpose of this project is to develop a system to manage the speaker list of Datateknologsektionens meetings. Preferably in the simplest possible way.

Feel free to fork, do pull requests and post issues!

The name is much inspired by DHack's totem animal, the [lemming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A6vm92R9oU).
