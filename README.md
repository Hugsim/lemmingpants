# Lemming pants

The purpose of this project is to develop a system to manage the speaker list of Datateknologsektionens meetings. Preferably in the simplest possible way.

Feel free to fork, do pull requests and post issues!

The name is much inspired by DHack's totem animal, the [lemming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A6vm92R9oU).

## Installation

The package is built using nix and cabal. Building it with stack might work, but it is not guaranteed, please file an issue if you have any problem building this package.

Build guide coming soon...
